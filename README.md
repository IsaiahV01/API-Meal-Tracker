# API-Meal-Tracker
Localhost API For tracking Meals - Calories, Protein, Carbs, Sugars


To access the API open then command prompt for the meals folder and the mealsWeb folder, then run npm install in each windows, wait for each to complete installing, then run npm start - first on meals then on mealsWeb.
After a few second you can go to localhost:3001 on a browser and you should see the front end welcome page. Create an account then login and you will see a button to add a meal. Fill out the form and click add meal and it should automatically create a "meal card" and the daily intake tracker should adjust the nutrients for today.
